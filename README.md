# Holocene_Reconstruction_paper_figures

These python scripts produce figures like those published in Erb et al., 2022: "Reconstructing Holocene temperature in time and space using paleoclimate data assimilation" (https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/18/2599/2022/).

Before use, you will have to:
 1) Download data
 2) Open scripts and update the directory names to your machine

Many of the scripts use the primary Holocene reconstruction found here: https://zenodo.org/record/6426332. For other reconstructions, refer to published papers. Alternate or pseudoproxy experiments used in some scripts have not been made publically available.
